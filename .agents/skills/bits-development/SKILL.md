# BITS development integration

Load this before Firstmate, or a crewmate Firstmate directs, creates, reuses, or updates a BITS Dev Task for code delivery, attaches projects, binds merge requests or Change Cards, or triggers or monitors BITS PPE, E2E, self-test, or quick-run pipelines.

This skill is the single owner of the Firstmate procedure for landing one or more already-completed code changes into BITS Dev Tasks and pipelines.
It governs the workflow and its safety, not the platform.
It is not a wrapper, control plane, or verifier around BITS, and it changes nothing in no-mistakes core.
When one code change or a set of related changes has reached a stable head with a known merge request, this skill decides how that work becomes a correct BITS Dev Task, Change Card, and pipeline run without inventing state or exceeding authority.

## Owners this skill defers to

Every mechanical fact lives with its existing owner; this skill only sequences and constrains them.

- BITS command mechanics, exact flags, dry-run and `--yes` semantics, project types, and control-plane values are owned by the bytedcli BITS skill and current `--help`; consult them at use time and never freeze volatile syntax here.
- BITS Dev Task creation is owned by the official `bits-devops-dev-task` skill, routed through the bytedcli BITS `references/dev-task.md`; use its `prepare -> confirm -> submit` flow when it is available and installed.
- Merge, delivery-mode, yolo, and captain-instruction authority are owned by `AGENTS.md` sections 1 and 7 and the captain-instruction precedence rule; this skill adds no authority and relaxes none.
- Long-poll monitoring without blocking a conversational turn is owned by `process-event-sources` and the `AGENTS.md` section 8 supervision contract.
- Project identity, registry, and delivery posture are owned by `project-management`.
- Producing and validating the code change itself, up to a green PR, is owned by the no-mistakes lifecycle in `AGENTS.md` section 7; BITS integration begins only after that work exists.

## Intake and project identity

Resolve which project each completed change belongs to before touching BITS, using the `project-management` identity rules, not a BITS project name guess.
Confirm the change is genuinely complete: it has a committed head, an opened merge request, and a settled target branch.
BITS integration is delivery of finished work, so do not start it for an in-flight branch whose head or target is still moving.

Gather the authoritative evidence for every change in the set before any decision:

- the exact repository identity and merge-request identity (BITS MR iid, and the underlying forge MR when relevant);
- the source branch, the current source head, and the intended target branch;
- for a release-train bugfix, the release ticket and its integration branch.

Read this evidence from the live forge and BITS, never from memory or from a stale status line.

## Create versus reuse

Decide, per Dev Task, whether to create a new one or reuse an existing one before running any write.
Read the current landscape first with the read-only BITS surfaces (Dev Task list, changes content, project list, Change Card list, pipeline and run reads) owned by the bytedcli BITS skill.
Reuse an existing Dev Task, project, or Change Card when one already covers the exact repository, source, and target; create only when nothing correct exists.
When the correct choice is ambiguous, stop and escalate rather than creating a parallel Dev Task that fragments the work.

## The write discipline

Apply this discipline to every live BITS mutation, without exception.

1. Complete pre-write readback: re-read the full current Dev Task changes content, projects, Change Cards, and `versionCode` immediately before the write, so the write is built on live state.
2. Full-snapshot preservation: attach, detach, and Change Card writes rewrite a whole snapshot, so preserve `changes`, `projects`, `versionCode`, and every unknown field; never overwrite or drop a field you did not intend to change.
3. Exact dry-run review: run the command's dry-run first and inspect the exact payload it will send, confirming repository, source, target, project type, control plane, and MR identity are precisely what you intend.
4. Explicit authority for each live write: obtain the authority each live write requires under `AGENTS.md` section 7 before adding `--yes`; one approval authorizes one exact target, not a later changed one.
5. Independent post-write readback: after the write, re-read the Dev Task, projects, Change Cards, MR bindings, and pipeline or job state from BITS and confirm the immutable fields match what you intended; API acceptance is not success until an independent read confirms it.
6. Timeout is outcome-unknown: treat a timeout or lost connection after transmitting a write as outcome-unknown, never as failure and never as success; reconcile by readback of the exact target before any retry, and never blindly re-issue a create.

Bind a merge request by its stable identity, never by a moving branch head.
The BITS MR iid and the repository, source, and target it carries are the durable identity; the branch head advances underneath it.
Verify the MR still points at the head you intend at bind time, and re-verify by readback, rather than assuming the head is unchanged.

## BITS operations

Run each operation through its owner with the write discipline above; the notes here are the conceptual boundaries, not the syntax.

- Dev Task creation: use the official `bits-devops-dev-task` `prepare -> confirm -> submit` flow when it is available, because it identifies projects and branches, merges multiple projects and repositories into one Dev Task, submits only the confirmed prepare snapshot, and reads back the created result.
  Use the lower-level bytedcli `develop create` path only when the official flow is genuinely unavailable and the captain has approved that fallback; it stays a fallback, not the default entry point.
- Multi-project coordination: combine related changes across projects and repositories into one Dev Task through a single official prepare rather than several independent submits, so one intent stays one delivery.
- Project attach and reuse: reuse an already-attached project when it matches; attach a new project only with an explicit branch for code projects, preserving the full snapshot and every Change Card.
- Change Card ensure, bind, and reuse: ensure or reuse the exact card for each repository, source, and target, add only genuinely missing cards, and bind an existing MR by iid; never let an ensure or attach silently clear existing cards or projects.
- Release-train target-branch constraints and auto-created MRs: on the release-train bugfix path, the target branch is constrained to the release ticket's integration branch, so let that path set the target rather than forcing a target to satisfy BITS, and reconcile any MR the platform auto-creates by reading it back and binding its real identity instead of creating a second one.
- Pipeline and project discovery: discover the current stage, tasks, projects, pipelines, and runs through the read-only surfaces before acting; treat an incomplete or unproven discovery result as a stop, not an assumption.
- PPE, E2E, self-test, and quick-run: trigger a deployment or test run only when the captain has explicitly authorized that run, because these are live operations; dry-run first where the command supports it, confirm the exact project, type, control plane, and target, and never let one authorization cover a later changed target.
- Monitoring and recovery: watch a running pipeline, deploy, or run through the `process-event-sources` long-poll supervision path instead of blocking a conversational turn, and recover after any interruption by reading BITS state back rather than inferring an outcome from a process exit or a single event.

## Safety boundaries

These boundaries hold regardless of yolo posture; only a current, explicit, concrete captain instruction of the exact action can relax one, per the captain-instruction precedence rule, and destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive actions still require the captain to name that exact action.

- Never remove a project or Change Card, or overwrite an unknown snapshot field, to make a write succeed.
- Never create a duplicate Dev Task after an uncertain submit; reconcile the uncertain outcome by readback first.
- Never retarget, create, or close a merge request merely to satisfy BITS; reconcile the real MR identity instead.
- Never pass a stage, force-skip a job, continue a release, deploy to production, merge, or roll back without the exact authority that existing Firstmate rules require for that action.
- Never persist, print, or paste a BITS token, service identity, cookie, JWT, or authorization header anywhere, including status lines, briefs, commits, or captain chat.

## Captain-facing outcome reporting

Report BITS outcomes as project outcomes, following `AGENTS.md` section 9, not as raw BITS mechanics, IDs, or command output.
Lead with what landed or is ready, its consequence, and the next decision, and include the full `https://...` URL of any merge request, Dev Task, or pipeline run the captain needs to act on.
Escalate to the captain for any merge, production deploy, release continuation, rollback, stage pass, or other destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive action before performing it, and for a credential or permission the integration needs.
